h2. PMS

Cross platform microblogging and event notification system.  This differs from the standard
microblogging software available, in that it allows the creation of private password protected groups.

PMS is split into 2 parts:
The server which is currently made for Google App Engine
The client, a Py-GTK app which polls the server and allows the user to send/recieve messages/events. This also allows the sending and recieving of Facebook status events.

Windows users can download an executable "here":http://github.com/woodenbrick/PMS/downloads

Ubuntu users can use the "download section":http://github.com/woodenbrick/PMS/downloads too, or add the "PPA":https://launchpad.net/~pms-client-team/+archive/ppa to get automatic updates.
Copy and paste the following into a terminal to achieve all this in one step:
echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pms-client-team/ppa/ubuntu hardy main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys A2996F07 && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pms-client
