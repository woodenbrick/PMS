h2. PMS

Cross platform microblogging and event notification system.  This differs from the standard
microblogging software available, in that it allows the creation of private password protected groups.

PMS is split into 2 parts:
The server which is currently made for Google App Engine
The client, a Py-GTK app which polls the server and allows the user to send/recieve messages/events.
